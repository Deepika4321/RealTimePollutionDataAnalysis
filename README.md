# RealTimePollutionDataAnalysis
🌍 Real-Time Pollution Data Analysis (India)
This project analyzes real-time pollution data across Indian states to identify trends, regional disparities, and significant differences using statistical and visual methods.
🔍 Objectives
Clean & preprocess real-time pollution data

Visualize pollutant distribution across states

Perform Z-tests to compare state-wise pollution

Compute skewness & explore data distribution

Highlight insights through box plots, heatmaps, pie & line charts
🔍 Key Insights
Top Polluted States: Identified the 10 most polluted states in India based on average pollutant levels, with states like Delhi and Maharashtra consistently ranking high.

Pollutant Distribution: Violin plots revealed the distribution and spread of pollutants across different types, showing which pollutants have more variability.

Outlier Detection: Box plots and IQR analysis flagged several extreme values in pollutant readings, which can affect environmental decision-making.

Skewness Analysis: Found skewed distributions in pollution data, indicating the need for transformations in modeling tasks.

Correlation Matrix: Strong positive correlation between pollutant min, max, and average values; suggesting consistency in data.

Statewise Trend Line: Line plots showcased clear statewise variations in pollution intensity across India.

Pollutant Proportions: Pie chart illustrated the dominance of certain pollutant types in the dataset.

Z-Test Result: Statistically tested and compared pollution levels between Delhi and Maharashtra, confirming a significant difference.
